This is a project I work on at my free time, its main purpose is for
understanding from first hand a compiler's logic. It is started from
scratch without any speciall compiler knowledge as an assignment for
a university lesson.

There is no plan of a full feature compiler for the real world needs
however it will be updated more or less often.
