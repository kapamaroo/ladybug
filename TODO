TODO list:

> fix bitmap support (broken)
> implement a more sophisticated register allocator
> implement magic tricks in math with constants (shift instead mult, etc..)
> reconsider structure of IR (very obscure in some cases, especially in subprogram calls)
> testing, testing, testing
> move optimizations outside of standard parsing for better structure and bug hunting!

> dependence analysis works only for very simple for statements

> make code generator more clever, avoid duplicate code
> implement prologue/epilogue for calls (save/restore registers)
> add timing statistics to actually measure performance gain of optimizers
